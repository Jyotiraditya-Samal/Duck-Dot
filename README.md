# Duck & Dot ü¶Ü vs ‚óè
A game where ducks and dots battle for grid supremacy. Now with *recursive existential crises*.

## How to Play
- **D-Pad**: Move cursor.
- **A Button**: Place your symbol.
- **Win by**:
  - 4-in-a-row (after expansion).
  - Creating a 2√ó2 square of your symbol.
- If the grid fills, it **expands from a random corner**. The ducks/dots are taking over!

## Build Instructions
1. Install DevKitPro (because coding for GBA is still easier than adulting).
2. Run `make`.
3. Load `duck_dot.gba` into your favorite emulator (or a real GBA if you‚Äôre old-school).

## Known Issues
- Ducks occasionally unionize and demand better working conditions.
- Grid expansion may cause mild existential dread.
